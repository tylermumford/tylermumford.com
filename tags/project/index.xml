      <description>Originally built with Jekyll and a fully custom theme, I decided to migrate the website to Hugo for better cross-platform testing support. Hugo was easy to get running, but the customization system took a couple hours to fully understand.
The theme is a slightly modified version of Hyde using the Merriweather font for the title. The Markdown parser automatically uses typographically correct quotes, and Hugo shortcodes help create a consistent visual appearance.</description>

      <title>SAVvie</title>

      <description>Prounounced like &amp;ldquo;savvy,&amp;rdquo; the name SAVvie comes from our initial prototype name, &amp;ldquo;Social Argument Voting,&amp;rdquo; and the verb &amp;ldquo;vie,&amp;rdquo; which means to compete. We imagined it to be an online implementation of Robert&amp;rsquo;s Rules of Order &amp;mdash; a place suitable for online debate and group decision-making.
SAVvie is a team project that was jump-started during the 24-hour Southern Utah Code Camp hackathon of 2016. I took on the responsibilities of a team leader for the four student developers who created the app: Katrina Mehring, Nick Rossi, Jacob Ward, and myself.</description>

      <title>Advanced Content Management</title>

      <description>Summary To simplify the creation of complicated page layouts, I developed a new &amp;ldquo;Advanced Page&amp;rdquo; content type in our CMS. Advanced pages have automatic support for custom row-and-column layouts and pluggable, reusable, structured component blocks.
   Advanced page multi-column demo screenshot   Background I work in the wonderful Web Services department of my university. I love my job, but our entire department has fewer than five employees supporting the entire university website: almost 3,000 pages and hundreds of faculty and staff.</description>

      <description>When the marketing department asked us to build a site for their newest campaign, &amp;ldquo;SUU to Everywhere,&amp;rdquo; I implemented the CMS page types and the CSS for the site&amp;rsquo;s design.
   SUU to Everywhere front page   At the time, our site didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything like this. A coworker and I planned a way for the new code to be reusable in other areas (specifically the university news).</description>

      <description>January 2016 &amp;ndash; July 2016
Falling Spikes is an iPhone game based on an idea by Scott Chapman. The player controls a bouncing ball by moving it left and right to avoid randomly falling spikes. Scott and I wanted to develop and publish this game for iOS devices with the hopes of making semi-passive income. His field is business, and mine is programming. The game took about 90 hours to create.</description>

      <description>Casino Game Maker, a local startup, approached me to create a new website. The company had me develop the site online, so I believe it&amp;rsquo;s public knowledge, but they never marketed the site and it is currently down. It involved large file distribution, multi-level managed user accounts, and online payments.
The site had two parts: the majority of it was built using CodeIgniter, an older PHP framework that was easy to use and nice to work with.</description>

      <description>Built during Southern Utah Code Camp 2014, JuxtaPros is a web app for quickly making lists of pros and cons. Jacob Ward and I came up with the idea, and we actually tried to build it for Code Camp two years in a row. The first year, we built the front end but ran out of time before we could build the back end (it didn&amp;rsquo;t help that neither of us had built a back end before).</description>

      <description>For a long time, Goodness was my most successful project: a Chrome extension designed to help people overcome pornography addictions. I sold it in 2013 with about 11,000 users, and has since grown (unmodified, as best I can tell; you can still see my name in the screenshot) to many more than that.
