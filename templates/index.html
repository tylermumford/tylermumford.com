### Hello ðŸ‘‹


This [site][] is mostly a place where I celebrate web development. I like many areas of software engineering, but web development is my home. The "Projects" section is where I show off work that I'm proud of (and some old things I used to be proud of).

Also... there are _so many_ fantastic dev blogs out there already. I want to start linking to them, and hopefully add something valuable with my voice, too.

I enjoy positive conversations on <a href="https://mas.to/@tylermumford" rel="me">Mastodon</a>, and I have a [GitHub][] profile where you can see the [source code for this site][source], if you like.

`// TODO: You can subscribe to this site's [JSON feed][] to read new posts as they come out. `

#### Fine print

This site uses [GoatCounter][] visitor analytics. I like knowing when people see my site, which posts they read, and the screen sizes people use. (So far, it's mostly phones and big computer screens.) You can block the JavaScript if you like, or [toggle][] the analytics for yourself. (A message will appear to tell you that it's been turned on or off.)
