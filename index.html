  Here’s my current plan for the code of Space Trader Returns. Space Trader is written in C, and I want to rewrite it in Go. These two languages have fairly similar syntax, and I think Go can express all the same concepts as C (and then some). So I’m converting the source files, mostly by hand.
I’d love to design the perfect architecture for this before writing a single line of code, and I’d love to rewrite everything from scratch rather than tweaking C source code.

  A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a game called Space Trader. Since smartphones hadn’t been invented yet, it ran on Palm devices. I was perhaps twelve years old at the time, and I loved to play this game. I spent weeks trading goods, fleeing from pirates and police, and trying to earn enough money to retire to my own moon.
Like most software of days past, Space Trader has been all but forgotten.

  <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 1, 2017</span>
  I chose to learn Go during my Programming Languages course in college, when we were told to find a new language to learn. I was tired of the chaos of JavaScript and PHP, and I was drawn to the idea of non-OO, statically typed code without manual memory management. While I haven&rsquo;t built anything professional-grade with Go yet, I have used it to begin building two sites (one of which works!

  <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 23, 2016</span>
  I want to respond to &ldquo;The Dark Side of Polyfilling CSS&rdquo; by Philip Walton. At the end of the article is this hashtag:
 #makecssfatigueathing
 I disagree completely. Putting aside the fact that the word &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; has only negative connotations, CSS is already different enough between browsers. If a CSS snippet&rsquo;s meaning can be changed at will by JavaScript, then:
 There will be more code in the rendering pipeline, and therefore more bugs Scripts can change the meaning of valid CSS, interfering with the CSS author&rsquo;s expectations and intentions Browser vendors can justify ignoring niche new features because the JS community will already have an implementation More JS has to be included in the page (yes, less than a polyfill, but a nonzero amount nonetheless) Instead of being processed by compiled and (hopefully) well-tested code, CSS will have to rely on JS &ndash; let that sink in.

  Originally built with Jekyll and a fully custom theme, I decided to migrate the website to Hugo for better cross-platform testing support. Hugo was easy to get running, but the customization system took a couple hours to fully understand.
The theme is a slightly modified version of Hyde using the Merriweather font for the title. The Markdown parser automatically uses typographically correct quotes, and Hugo shortcodes help create a consistent visual appearance.

  <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 11, 2016</span>
  Prounounced like &ldquo;savvy,&rdquo; the name SAVvie comes from our initial prototype name, &ldquo;Social Argument Voting,&rdquo; and the verb &ldquo;vie,&rdquo; which means to compete. We imagined it to be an online implementation of Robert&rsquo;s Rules of Order &mdash; a place suitable for online debate and group decision-making.
SAVvie is a team project that was jump-started during the 24-hour Southern Utah Code Camp hackathon of 2016. I took on the responsibilities of a team leader for the four student developers who created the app: Katrina Mehring, Nick Rossi, Jacob Ward, and myself.

  Summary To simplify the creation of complicated page layouts, I developed a new &ldquo;Advanced Page&rdquo; content type in our CMS. Advanced pages have automatic support for custom row-and-column layouts and pluggable, reusable, structured component blocks.

  When the marketing department asked us to build a site for their newest campaign, &ldquo;SUU to Everywhere,&rdquo; I implemented the CMS page types and the CSS for the site&rsquo;s design.

  January 2016 &ndash; July 2016
Falling Spikes is an iPhone game based on an idea by Scott Chapman. The player controls a bouncing ball by moving it left and right to avoid randomly falling spikes. Scott and I wanted to develop and publish this game for iOS devices with the hopes of making semi-passive income. His field is business, and mine is programming. The game took about 90 hours to create.

  </h1>
  <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 20, 2015</span>
  Casino Game Maker, a local startup, approached me to create a new website. The company had me develop the site online, so I believe it&rsquo;s public knowledge, but they never marketed the site and it is currently down. It involved large file distribution, multi-level managed user accounts, and online payments.
The site had two parts: the majority of it was built using CodeIgniter, an older PHP framework that was easy to use and nice to work with.

  Built during Southern Utah Code Camp 2014, JuxtaPros is a web app for quickly making lists of pros and cons. Jacob Ward and I came up with the idea, and we actually tried to build it for Code Camp two years in a row. The first year, we built the front end but ran out of time before we could build the back end (it didn&rsquo;t help that neither of us had built a back end before).

  Three days ago, Apple gave its 2013 WWDC keynote presentation. They announced OS X Mavericks, the new Mac Pro, and a new design for iOS 7. I&rsquo;m taking the opportunity to move my own development efforts forward, by creating Mindful Code. Under this name, I intend to create apps for iOS and Mac that truly understand how people think of and interact with their systems.
The definition of &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; has nothing to do with beauty, versatility, or even ease of use.
