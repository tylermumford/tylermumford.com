    <h1>Advanced Content Management</h1>
    <hr/>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>To simplify the creation of complicated page layouts, I developed a new "Advanced Page" content type in our CMS. Advanced pages have automatic support for custom row-and-column layouts and pluggable, reusable, structured component blocks.</p>
<p>{{&lt; figure src="/images/advanced-3.png" link="/images/advanced-3.png" caption="Advanced page multi-column demo screenshot" &gt;}}</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I work in the wonderful Web Services department of my university. I love my job, but our entire department has fewer than five employees supporting the entire university website: almost <strong>3,000</strong> pages and hundreds of faculty and staff. Most of them contact us with updates, and a few make their own changes in the CMS.</p>
<p>Our site uses Bootstrap's grid system, and many of our pages require custom multi-column layouts. Unfortunately, our CMS's WYSIWYG editor doesn't support multi-column layouts except via hand-coded HTML. This meant that Web Services had to be involved whenever someone needed a change to these pages, and we had to be careful not to <strong>break the layout</strong> when adding or removing columns.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>When summer started, I spent a few weeks learning how our CMS could be customized. I developed a <strong>new page rendering system</strong> (using Apache Velocity, if you're curious) that had built-in support for multi-row and multi-column layouts. At the same time, I added support for <strong>reusable</strong> blocks of WYSIWYG content. These blocks are structured and their WYSYWIG interface can be customized.</p>
