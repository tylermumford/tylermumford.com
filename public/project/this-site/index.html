    <h1>This Website!</h1>
    <hr/>

    <p>This is a simple website. It's all about Markdown and HTML.</p>
<h2 id="gen-3-mountain-snow">Gen 3 üèîÔ∏è</h2>
<p>The site is currently using the <strong>Zola</strong> static site generator to put everything together. The HTML and CSS are written by me. I'm really pleased with the look and feel. I've learned a lot about web development in the last five years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using a web font anymore</li>
<li>Not using JavaScript (yet)</li>
</ul>
<p>The web font I was using before was nice, but eventually I realized that I was letting Google "see" every page load on my site. I hope it's not doing as much tracking as Google Analytics, but I still don't want it anywhere near my digital life right now.</p>
<p>This site doesn't need JavaScript yet. I have a grand total of <strong>twelve posts</strong> right now. If I ever decide to add comments, search, or analytics, then there will be a bit of JS.</p>
<p><code>// TODO: Write a blog post about the new design &amp; implementation</code></p>
<h2 id="gen-2">Gen 2 ‚ùáÔ∏è</h2>
<p>I decided to migrate the website to <strong>Hugo</strong> for better cross-platform testing support. Hugo was easy to get running, but the customization system took a couple hours to fully understand.</p>
<p>The theme was a slightly modified version of Hyde using the Merriweather font for the title. The Markdown parser automatically uses typographically correct quotes, and Hugo shortcodes help create a consistent visual appearance.</p>
<p>(But Hugo is <em>complicated</em>. Eventually, I got tired of using someone else's theme and the feeling that I couldn't modify <em>all</em> of the site's HTML and CSS.)</p>
<h2 id="gen-1-golf">Gen 1 ‚õ≥Ô∏è</h2>
<p>Originally built with <strong>Jekyll</strong> and a fully custom theme. This was back in... wow, 2013 (<a href="https://tylermumford.com/post/inaugural-entry/">first post, cringe</a>). I guess I've had a website for ten years now.</p>
<p>Apparently, I originally called the site "Mindful Code." I thought I needed a "company name" or something. Seems silly, in retrospect, but I guess I was a silly teenager.</p>
