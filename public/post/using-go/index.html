    <h1>Using Go</h1>
    <hr/>

    <p>I chose to learn Go during my Programming Languages course in college, when we were told to find a new language to learn. I was tired of the chaos of JavaScript and PHP, and I was drawn to the idea of non-OO, statically typed code without manual memory management. While I haven't built anything professional-grade with Go yet, I have used it to begin building two sites (one of which works! ;), and I love it.</p>
<p>Even though I don't have a lot of experience with Go, I feel confident in my ability to use the language well. And even though I haven't finished these side projects, I do finish the work I get paid for.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-ve-done">What I've Done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meal Picker (not working)<br />
This is a tiny project I started to help my wife and I choose what to eat. It was some of the first Go code I wrote, and I tried to do it without depending on a database, so it stores data in CSV files. When I pick it up again, I think I want to use <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">Bolt</a> instead.</li>
<li>SAVvie (working, but not finished)<br />
This was a group project that I made with fellow students. We each wanted to use a different language, so it's not an example of how I'd structure a production service! But I did do a (to my mind) substantial amount of work in Go, and the site's basic functionality is usable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-still-want-to-do">What I Still Want to Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Work on a large Go codebase<br />
Go is so easy to read and work with. I'm looking forward to the day when I can really use this language in a big project.</li>
<li>Port Space Trader to Go<br />
Back in the day, I used to absolutely love playing the game <a href="https://www.spronck.net/spacetrader/STNoFrames.html">Space Trader</a> on my Palm Pilot. I want to bring it back with modern ports for some combination of desktop, web, and mobile, and I think I want to do it in Go.</li>
</ul>
