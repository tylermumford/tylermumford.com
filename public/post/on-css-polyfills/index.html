    <h1>On CSS Polyfills</h1>
    <hr/>

    <p>I want to respond to "<a href="https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-dark-side-of-polyfilling-css/">The Dark Side of Polyfilling CSS</a>" by Philip Walton. At the end of the article is this hashtag:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#makecssfatigueathing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree completely. Putting aside the fact that the word "fatigue" has only negative connotations, CSS is already different enough between browsers. If a CSS snippet's meaning can be changed at will by JavaScript, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be more code in the rendering pipeline, and therefore more bugs</li>
<li>Scripts can change the meaning of <em>valid</em> CSS, interfering with the CSS author's expectations and intentions</li>
<li>Browser vendors can justify ignoring niche new features because the JS community will already have an implementation</li>
<li>More JS has to be included in the page (yes, less than a polyfill, but a nonzero amount nonetheless)</li>
<li>Instead of being processed by compiled and (hopefully) well-tested code, CSS will have to rely on JS -- let that sink in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where does it end?? I strongly believe in the separation of concerns, and in using the right tool for the job. At what point does an application just ignore HTML/CSS and run entirely in JavaScript? (Yes, I'm sure it's already being done.) You might as well ship a desktop app if you're just using the browser as an execution environment.</p>
<p>The difficulty of polyfilling CSS should convince developers to write simple, backwards-compatible, and extensible CSS; not to make it more complicated.</p>
