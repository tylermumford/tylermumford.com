      <description>Originally built with Jekyll and a fully custom theme, I decided to migrate the website to Hugo for better cross-platform testing support. Hugo was easy to get running, but the customization system took a couple hours to fully understand.
The theme is a slightly modified version of Hyde using the Merriweather font for the title. The Markdown parser automatically uses typographically correct quotes, and Hugo shortcodes help create a consistent visual appearance.</description>

      <title>SAVvie</title>

      <description>Prounounced like &amp;ldquo;savvy,&amp;rdquo; the name SAVvie comes from our initial prototype name, &amp;ldquo;Social Argument Voting,&amp;rdquo; and the verb &amp;ldquo;vie,&amp;rdquo; which means to compete. We imagined it to be an online implementation of Robert&amp;rsquo;s Rules of Order &amp;mdash; a place suitable for online debate and group decision-making.
SAVvie is a team project that was jump-started during the 24-hour Southern Utah Code Camp hackathon of 2016. I took on the responsibilities of a team leader for the four student developers who created the app: Katrina Mehring, Nick Rossi, Jacob Ward, and myself.</description>

      <description>Casino Game Maker, a local startup, approached me to create a new website. The company had me develop the site online, so I believe it&amp;rsquo;s public knowledge, but they never marketed the site and it is currently down. It involved large file distribution, multi-level managed user accounts, and online payments.
The site had two parts: the majority of it was built using CodeIgniter, an older PHP framework that was easy to use and nice to work with.</description>

      <description>Built during Southern Utah Code Camp 2014, JuxtaPros is a web app for quickly making lists of pros and cons. Jacob Ward and I came up with the idea, and we actually tried to build it for Code Camp two years in a row. The first year, we built the front end but ran out of time before we could build the back end (it didn&amp;rsquo;t help that neither of us had built a back end before).</description>
