      <description>Casino Game Maker, a local startup, approached me to create a new website. The company had me develop the site online, so I believe it&amp;rsquo;s public knowledge, but they never marketed the site and it is currently down. It involved large file distribution, multi-level managed user accounts, and online payments.
The site had two parts: the majority of it was built using CodeIgniter, an older PHP framework that was easy to use and nice to work with.</description>
