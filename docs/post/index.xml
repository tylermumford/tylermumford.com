      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a newcomer to Visual Studio, and at work, I use it to develop projects written in both .NET Framework and newer .NET versions. Occasionally, when I want to edit or view a .csproj file, Visual Studio will open a GUI instead.
This is absolutely maddening for me.
For a while, this had me thinking that Visual Studio was foolishly designed around its own features instead of being focused on my files.</description>

      <title>Code Expressiveness Tests</title>

      <description>When writing a project with unit tests, I find it helpful to write a few tests that are more about what the code expresses, rather than what it does.
I thought of the concept and the name when writing code for a chess game (side project, private repo). I wanted to write some unit tests that got me started with some class names, method names, and high-level concepts in the code.</description>

      <title>Advent of Code 2022</title>

      <description>This year, I discovered Advent of Code, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a ton of fun! I want to write about my experience with the puzzles. While this has the potential to mostly be me rambling on, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make it interesting.
I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to speed through these puzzles or even solve them the night they come out. I work on most of them days after they&amp;rsquo;re released.
So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Go, Lua, C#, and Python.</description>

      <title>Touching Up the Site</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since I updated this site, and now I want to update it again. I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked the theme to be primarily dark, I&amp;rsquo;ll add some links to recent projects, and I&amp;rsquo;ll backdate some new posts to kind of make this a &amp;ldquo;journal&amp;rdquo; of my experience with software development.</description>

      <title>Space Trader Journal 2</title>

      <description>Here’s my current plan for the code of Space Trader Returns. Space Trader is written in C, and I want to rewrite it in Go. These two languages have fairly similar syntax, and I think Go can express all the same concepts as C (and then some). So I’m converting the source files, mostly by hand.
I’d love to design the perfect architecture for this before writing a single line of code, and I’d love to rewrite everything from scratch rather than tweaking C source code.</description>

      <description>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a game called Space Trader. Since smartphones hadn’t been invented yet, it ran on Palm devices. I was perhaps twelve years old at the time, and I loved to play this game. I spent weeks trading goods, fleeing from pirates and police, and trying to earn enough money to retire to my own moon.
Like most software of days past, Space Trader has been all but forgotten.</description>

      <title>Using Go</title>

      <description>I chose to learn Go during my Programming Languages course in college, when we were told to find a new language to learn. I was tired of the chaos of JavaScript and PHP, and I was drawn to the idea of non-OO, statically typed code without manual memory management. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t built anything professional-grade with Go yet, I have used it to begin building two sites (one of which works!</description>

      <title>On CSS Polyfills</title>

      <description>I want to respond to &amp;ldquo;The Dark Side of Polyfilling CSS&amp;rdquo; by Philip Walton. At the end of the article is this hashtag:
#makecssfatigueathing
I disagree completely. Putting aside the fact that the word &amp;ldquo;fatigue&amp;rdquo; has only negative connotations, CSS is already different enough between browsers. If a CSS snippet&amp;rsquo;s meaning can be changed at will by JavaScript, then:
There will be more code in the rendering pipeline, and therefore more bugs Scripts can change the meaning of valid CSS, interfering with the CSS author&amp;rsquo;s expectations and intentions Browser vendors can justify ignoring niche new features because the JS community will already have an implementation More JS has to be included in the page (yes, less than a polyfill, but a nonzero amount nonetheless) Instead of being processed by compiled and (hopefully) well-tested code, CSS will have to rely on JS &amp;ndash; let that sink in.</description>

      <title>Inaugural Entry</title>
      <link>https://tylermumford.com/post/inaugural-entry/</link>

      <description>Three days ago, Apple gave its 2013 WWDC keynote presentation. They announced OS X Mavericks, the new Mac Pro, and a new design for iOS 7. I&amp;rsquo;m taking the opportunity to move my own development efforts forward, by creating Mindful Code. Under this name, I intend to create apps for iOS and Mac that truly understand how people think of and interact with their systems.
The definition of &amp;ldquo;mindful&amp;rdquo; has nothing to do with beauty, versatility, or even ease of use.</description>
