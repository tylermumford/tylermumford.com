  <h1>The Wrong Way to Avoid XML</h1>
  <time datetime=2023-01-31T01:46:00-0700 class="post-date">Tue, Jan 31, 2023</time>
  <p>I&rsquo;m a newcomer to Visual Studio, and at work, I use it to develop projects
written in both .NET Framework and newer .NET versions. Occasionally, when I
want to edit or view a <code>.csproj</code> file, Visual Studio will open a GUI instead.</p>
<p>This is absolutely <em>maddening</em> for me.</p>
<p>For a while, this had me thinking that Visual Studio was foolishly designed
around its own features instead of being focused on my files. I believed that
this was the opposite of what a text editor should be about. (I still believe
that.) I wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/yxq6tt/comment/iwqx5b6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this comment on Reddit</a> about it, which sparked my
motivation to write this blog post. The original title was &ldquo;Editors vs IDEs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m starting to see that it&rsquo;s not Visual Studio per se, it&rsquo;s Microsoft and
the age of XML.</p>
<h2 id="the-original-approach">The original approach</h2>
<p>For many years, XML was widely used for configuration, serialization, and
content markup. It&rsquo;s a versatile format, but it&rsquo;s overly verbose. Developers in
general hate working with XML; they want to avoid it.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m pretty young. I wasn&rsquo;t a professional developer
during XML&rsquo;s heyday, and I might not have this context right. This is based on
my impressions from reading a <em>lot</em> of Internet content and programming blogs.</p>
<p><strong>It seems to me that Microsoft&rsquo;s approach to managing the flood of XML was to
abstract it away with GUI tools.</strong> IIS Manager and Visual Studio developed lots
of wizards and features to let developers configure things without touching the
XML by hand.</p>
<p>So you have XML files for server configuration, app configuration, project
configuration, and probably others that I&rsquo;m forgetting, but you&rsquo;re not supposed
to actually touch them. You&rsquo;re supposed to let the GUI do the work.</p>
<h2 id="bzzt-problems">Bzzt, problems</h2>
<p>There are two problems with this approach. The first problem is that it didn&rsquo;t
match the approach of the open source ecosystem. The web developed languages
like JSON and YAML and TOML, which are all designed to be <em>both</em> human-friendly
and machine-friendly (except YAML).</p>
<p>Instead of hiding XML, programmers abandoned it. By force.</p>
<p>The second problem is that when you put everything in GUIs and wizards, you lose
the most powerful advantage of software: after-the-fact automation. Gluing
separate components together through interoperability. Tinkering.</p>
<h2 id="microsofts-turnaround">Microsoft&rsquo;s turnaround</h2>
<p>Microsoft realized this and developed .NET Core and Visual Studio Code. They
steered their entire ecosystem towards the same goals of other open source
ecosystems: embracing the advantages of the command line and using
human-friendly configuration files.</p>
<p>Visual Studio still provides excellent productivity benefits when working with
C# projects (especially large ones). The IDE is still valuable. But it&rsquo;s no
longer the only way to work. You can use a text editor and <code>dotnet</code> if you want,
and Microsoft provides well-written documentation to support that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad for this turnaround, because my mental model of sofware
development is one of files and commands. If I were trying to use a GUI, but I
couldn&rsquo;t get a basic idea of the shell commands and file operations it were
performing under the hood, it would be frustrating for me.</p>
<p>And now if you use Visual Studio in this new .NET world, it lets you edit the
freaking project files.</p>
