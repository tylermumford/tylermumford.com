  <p>I have a bit of a dilemma. I don&rsquo;t like detailed tracking on the web; I think it&rsquo;s intrusive and dumb. And I don&rsquo;t need it for my sites, anyway. I&rsquo;m not growing businesses.</p>
<p>But I also really like external validation, so I want to have some way of knowing when people check out my websites. So I&rsquo;m trying to find a way to balance these two things.</p>

  I&rsquo;m a newcomer to Visual Studio, and at work, I use it to develop projects written in both .NET Framework and newer .NET versions. Occasionally, when I want to edit or view a .csproj file, Visual Studio will open a GUI instead.
This is absolutely maddening for me.
For a while, this had me thinking that Visual Studio was foolishly designed around its own features instead of being focused on my files.

  When writing a project with unit tests, I find it helpful to write a few tests that are more about what the code expresses, rather than what it does.
I thought of the concept and the name when writing code for a chess game (side project, private repo). I wanted to write some unit tests that got me started with some class names, method names, and high-level concepts in the code.

  This year, I discovered Advent of Code, and it&rsquo;s been a ton of fun! I want to write about my experience with the puzzles. While this has the potential to mostly be me rambling on, I&rsquo;ll try to make it interesting.
I&rsquo;m not trying to speed through these puzzles or even solve them the night they come out. I work on most of them days after they&rsquo;re released.
So far, I&rsquo;ve used Go, Lua, C#, and Python.

  I enjoyed the Stock Market Game so much that I wanted to create another pandemic-friendly game people could play together over a voice/video call. On a whim, I decided to create a multiplayer version of minesweeper.
Of course, other people had done this before, but everything I found online involved players working together on the same area of mines. I wanted my version to feel more original, so I decided that players would work on different minefields, but their fields would be linked.

  I learned about the stock market game from my brother-in-law during the pandemic. We originally played it with the help of a spreadsheet, and it was a lot of fun. I decided to make a dedicated web app for playing the game.
(It&rsquo;s not really about the stock market, but &ldquo;stock market game&rdquo; is what we&rsquo;ve always called it.)
It&rsquo;s a single page app with no backend, so it&rsquo;s just about tracking game state in memory.

  Here’s my current plan for the code of Space Trader Returns. Space Trader is written in C, and I want to rewrite it in Go. These two languages have fairly similar syntax, and I think Go can express all the same concepts as C (and then some). So I’m converting the source files, mostly by hand.
I’d love to design the perfect architecture for this before writing a single line of code, and I’d love to rewrite everything from scratch rather than tweaking C source code.

  A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a game called Space Trader. Since smartphones hadn’t been invented yet, it ran on Palm devices. I was perhaps twelve years old at the time, and I loved to play this game. I spent weeks trading goods, fleeing from pirates and police, and trying to earn enough money to retire to my own moon.
Like most software of days past, Space Trader has been all but forgotten.

  I chose to learn Go during my Programming Languages course in college, when we were told to find a new language to learn. I was tired of the chaos of JavaScript and PHP, and I was drawn to the idea of non-OO, statically typed code without manual memory management. While I haven&rsquo;t built anything professional-grade with Go yet, I have used it to begin building two sites (one of which works!

  I want to respond to &ldquo;The Dark Side of Polyfilling CSS&rdquo; by Philip Walton. At the end of the article is this hashtag:
#makecssfatigueathing
I disagree completely. Putting aside the fact that the word &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; has only negative connotations, CSS is already different enough between browsers. If a CSS snippet&rsquo;s meaning can be changed at will by JavaScript, then:
There will be more code in the rendering pipeline, and therefore more bugs Scripts can change the meaning of valid CSS, interfering with the CSS author&rsquo;s expectations and intentions Browser vendors can justify ignoring niche new features because the JS community will already have an implementation More JS has to be included in the page (yes, less than a polyfill, but a nonzero amount nonetheless) Instead of being processed by compiled and (hopefully) well-tested code, CSS will have to rely on JS &ndash; let that sink in.

  Originally built with Jekyll and a fully custom theme, I decided to migrate the website to Hugo for better cross-platform testing support. Hugo was easy to get running, but the customization system took a couple hours to fully understand.
The theme is a slightly modified version of Hyde using the Merriweather font for the title. The Markdown parser automatically uses typographically correct quotes, and Hugo shortcodes help create a consistent visual appearance.

  Prounounced like &ldquo;savvy,&rdquo; the name SAVvie comes from our initial prototype name, &ldquo;Social Argument Voting,&rdquo; and the verb &ldquo;vie,&rdquo; which means to compete. We imagined it to be an online implementation of Robert&rsquo;s Rules of Order &mdash; a place suitable for online debate and group decision-making.
SAVvie is a team project that was jump-started during the 24-hour Southern Utah Code Camp hackathon of 2016. I took on the responsibilities of a team leader for the four student developers who created the app: Katrina Mehring, Nick Rossi, Jacob Ward, and myself.

Falling Spikes is an iPhone game based on an idea by Scott Chapman. The player controls a bouncing ball by moving it left and right to avoid randomly falling spikes. Scott and I wanted to develop and publish this game for iOS devices with the hopes of making semi-passive income. His field is business, and mine is programming. The game took about 90 hours to create.

  Casino Game Maker, a local startup, approached me to create a new website. The company had me develop the site online, so I believe it&rsquo;s public knowledge, but they never marketed the site and it is currently down. It involved large file distribution, multi-level managed user accounts, and online payments.
The site had two parts: the majority of it was built using CodeIgniter, an older PHP framework that was easy to use and nice to work with.
