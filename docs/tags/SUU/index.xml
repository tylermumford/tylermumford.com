      <description>Summary To simplify the creation of complicated page layouts, I developed a new &amp;ldquo;Advanced Page&amp;rdquo; content type in our CMS. Advanced pages have automatic support for custom row-and-column layouts and pluggable, reusable, structured component blocks.

Background I work in the wonderful Web Services department of my university. I love my job, but our entire department has fewer than five employees supporting the entire university website: almost 3,000 pages and hundreds of faculty and staff.</description>

      <description>When the marketing department asked us to build a site for their newest campaign, &amp;ldquo;SUU to Everywhere,&amp;rdquo; I implemented the CMS page types and the CSS for the site&amp;rsquo;s design.

At the time, our site didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything like this. A coworker and I planned a way for the new code to be reusable in other areas (specifically the university news). We made structured page types for the stories so Marketing could easily create and edit the stories.</description>
