# It's a website

And it's mine. I enjoy making things on the web.

It's built with Zola.

## Notes to myself

- The `public` dir should be tracked on the `deploy` branch, but not on `main`.
- Some posts are tagged, but I have stopped caring about tags.
- I think of project pages as simply evergreen pages, dated
with the project's approximate creation date.
