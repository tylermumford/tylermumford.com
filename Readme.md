# It's a website

And it's mine. I enjoy making things on the web. :shrug:

It's built with Hugo.

## Notes to myself

- Some posts are tagged, but I have stopped caring about tags.
- I think of project pages as simply evergreen pages, dated
with the project's approximate creation date.
- `hugo --cleanDestinationDir && git add docs && git commit -m Build`
