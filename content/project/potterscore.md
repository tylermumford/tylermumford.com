[Potterscore][here] is a simple but **pretty** score-keeping tool. It is designed to be used at an in-person Harry Potter-themed party, with House Points nicely displayed on a large screen.

I didn't create the graphics; my sister did. She's great!

As long as it's free for me to host (and it is, because it's a static site), you can see it and use it as much as you like.
