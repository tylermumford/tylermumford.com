## Slow Animations for Focusing

[https://slowanimations.com](https://slowanimations.com)

A collection of slow, undistracting animations
that you can use for focusing or other -ings.

When I created this project, I had two main purposes:
to make money (eventually),
and to learn how to create animations.

So far, I'm accomplishing the second purpose.
