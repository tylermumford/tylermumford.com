I learned about the stock market game from my brother-in-law during the pandemic. We originally
played it with the help of a spreadsheet, and it was a lot of fun. I decided to make a dedicated
web app for playing the game.

(It's not really about the stock market, but "stock market game" is what we've always called it.)

It's a single page app with no backend, so it's just about tracking game state in memory. It's
intended to be played either in person, or over something like Zoomâ€”one player can share their
screen so everyone can see the game and the scores.

It's proved to be fun, and I've shared it with other family members.
