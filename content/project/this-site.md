This is a simple website. It's all about Markdown and HTML.

## Gen 3

The site is currently using the **Zola** static site generator to put everything together. The HTML and CSS are written by me. I'm really pleased with the look and feel. I've learned a lot about web development in the last five years.

- Not using a web font anymore
- Not using JavaScript (yet)

The web font I was using before was nice, but eventually I realized that I was letting Google "see" every page load on my site. I hope it's not doing as much tracking as Google Analytics, but I still don't want it anywhere near my digital life right now.

JavaScript just isn't necessary on a site this simple. (I have a grand total of **twelve posts** right now. No need for search, dynamic content, or any interactivity, really.)

`// TODO: Write a blog post about the new design & implementation`


## Gen 2

I decided to migrate the website to **Hugo** for better cross-platform testing support. Hugo was easy to get running, but the customization system took a couple hours to fully understand.

The theme was a slightly modified version of [Hyde](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/) using the Merriweather font for the title. The Markdown parser automatically uses typographically correct quotes, and Hugo shortcodes help create a consistent visual appearance.

(But Hugo is _complicated_. Eventually, I got tired of using someone else's theme and the feeling that I couldn't modify _all_ of the site's HTML and CSS.)

## Gen 1

Originally built with **Jekyll** and a fully custom theme. This was back in... wow, 2013 ([first post, cringe][first]). I guess I've had a website for ten years now.
