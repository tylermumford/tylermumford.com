Originally built with Jekyll and a fully custom theme, I decided to migrate the website to **Hugo** for better cross-platform testing support. Hugo was easy to get running, but the customization system took a couple hours to fully understand.

The theme is a slightly modified version of [Hyde](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/) using the Merriweather font for the title. The Markdown parser automatically uses typographically correct quotes, and Hugo shortcodes help create a consistent visual appearance.
