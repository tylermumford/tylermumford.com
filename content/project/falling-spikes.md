Falling Spikes is an iPhone game based on an idea by Scott Chapman. The player controls a bouncing ball by moving it left and right to avoid randomly falling spikes. Scott and I wanted to develop and publish this game for iOS devices with the hopes of making semi-passive income. His field is business, and mine is programming. The game took about 90 hours to create.

The game is currently in the process of being submitted to the App Store.
