Three days ago, Apple gave its 2013 WWDC keynote presentation. They announced OS X Mavericks, the new Mac Pro, and a new design for iOS 7. I'm taking the opportunity to move my own development efforts forward, by creating Mindful Code. Under this name, I intend to create apps for iOS and Mac that truly understand how people think of and interact with their systems.

The definition of "mindful" has nothing to do with beauty, versatility, or even ease of use. To be mindful is to be aware of truth, and to respect it. Only when software is mindful of its users can it become an extension of their thinking. And then? *Then* it becomes beautiful.
