+++

I use Firefox as my main browser,
especially on desktops.
I rely on many of its features,
and I also really don't want to use Chrome
or a Chromium-based browser.

Google has been marketing Chrome for years and years,
and it's becoming a problem.
The web is supposed to be an open platform,
**not controlled by any one company or government.**
But because millions and millions of people use Chrome,
Google has a huge amount of power over the web.
They use that power to
try to thwart ad blocking and
track people's online activity.

But there are some great features in Firefox
that I want more people to know about.
Maybe these will convince you to leave Chrome,
at least for a day or two?

I'm gonna start right away with my favorite feature.
Hit the ' (apostrophe) key on any webpage
to open up a search box at the bottom of Firefox.

It's a search box for links on the current page.
Type part of the text of a link,
and it'll be highlighted instantly.
Press enter to follow the link!
Press Cmd+G and Cmd+Shift+G to select the next/previous matching link.

This is a dream come true for people who enjoy using the keyboard.
Instead of using your eyes to hunt for a tiny
About link in the footer or a standard Log In link,
you can quickly find it with this search feature.

When I asked on the Fediverse what people's favorite Firefox features were,
several people responded with the container tabs feature. (An extension.)

Have you ever wanted to be logged into the same website
with two different accounts at the same time?
Container tabs let you do this and more.
This means, for example, you could log into Discord
with two different accounts in two different tabs.
The container tabs feature also lets you isolate websites
like Facebook or Amazon or Google into their own containers automatically,
so your logged-in sessions on those websites cannot track your other browsing activity in other container tabs,

The next big feature fire fox has is reader mode. This is designed to work on webpages that look like articles when your activate reader mode fire fox finds just the title and text of the article you're trying to read and displays it to you without any clutter or advertisements or pop-ups chrome used to have this feature but of course, since at Heinz ads, Google did not let it last for long.
