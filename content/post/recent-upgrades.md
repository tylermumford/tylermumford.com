Inspired by Julia Evans's article, [A list of new(ish) command line tools][article], I have made many upgrades to my command line toolbelt recently.

## My Three Champions

- Make ‚û°Ô∏è [Just][]
- bash ‚û°Ô∏è zsh ‚û°Ô∏è PowerShell ‚û°Ô∏è [Nushell][]
- (nothing) ‚û°Ô∏è [Scoop][]

[Just]: https://just.systems
[Nushell]: https://www.nushell.sh
[Scoop]: https://scoop.sh

Just is like Make, but way better, because you don't have to declare `.PHONY` everywhere. It's command-oriented instead of being input-output-file-oriented like Make. It has great features like doc comments, parameters, and OS-specific recipe implementations.

Confession time... I still fear/loathe the syntax of shell scripts for anything with a cyclomatic complexity greater than one. That's part of why I love PowerShell: super usable as a shell, but with a familiar-looking programming language built in. (And holy crap, I hope I never have to touch `cmd.exe` again.)

But *Nushell* has all the advantages of PowerShell with two more big advantages: brevity and Unix-y-ness. It's the shell of my dreams. üíñ

Finally, Scoop is the package manager that makes Windows actually easy to like. So many great tools are available, only one `install` command away. It's just as good as Homebrew, in my opinion.

## Even more

That's not all. Here are some more upgrades I've made lately (and some not so lately).

- cat ‚û°Ô∏è bat
- grep ‚û°Ô∏è ripgrep
- find ‚û°Ô∏è fd
- man ‚û°Ô∏è tldr (sort of)
- cd ‚û°Ô∏è z

And for some super opinionated upgrades:

- Regular text editing ‚û°Ô∏è Vim-mode everywhere
- Hugo ‚û°Ô∏è makesite.py ‚û°Ô∏è Zola

## What makes a good tool?

Docs. Seriously, great documentation is the telltale sign of a great tool.

The only thing better than a great tool with great docs is a great tool that's so simple, its built-in help is sufficient. That's the case with the new generation of single-purpose tools like `bat`, `rg`, and `fd`.

Apart from that, yeah, ease of use, features, speed, all that stuff is important, too.

### Rust?

(A lot of these new tools are written in Rust. New languages really do enable new patterns of thinking. Try lots of programming languages.)
