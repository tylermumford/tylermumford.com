+++

I chose to learn Go during my Programming Languages course in college, when we were told to find a new language to learn. I was tired of the chaos of JavaScript and PHP, and I was drawn to the idea of non-OO, statically typed code without manual memory management. While I haven't built anything professional-grade with Go yet, I have used it to begin building two sites (one of which works! ;), and I love it.

Even though I don't have a lot of experience with Go, I feel confident in my ability to use the language well. And even though I haven't finished these side projects, I do finish the work I get paid for.

## What I've Done

- Meal Picker (not working)  
    This is a tiny project I started to help my wife and I choose what to eat. It was some of the first Go code I wrote, and I tried to do it without depending on a database, so it stores data in CSV files. When I pick it up again, I think I want to use [Bolt](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) instead.
- SAVvie (working, but not finished)  
    This was a group project that I made with fellow students. We each wanted to use a different language, so it's not an example of how I'd structure a production service! But I did do a (to my mind) substantial amount of work in Go, and the site's basic functionality is usable.

## What I Still Want to Do

- Work on a large Go codebase  
    Go is so easy to read and work with. I'm looking forward to the day when I can really use this language in a big project.
- Port Space Trader to Go  
    Back in the day, I used to absolutely love playing the game [Space Trader](http://www.spronck.net/spacetrader/STFrames.html) on my Palm Pilot. I want to bring it back with modern ports for some combination of desktop, web, and mobile, and I think I want to do it in Go.
