This post is about a [conversation I had on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/yxq6tt/comment/iwqx5b6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
The full context is difficult to convey, but I want to elaborate on the differences I see
between full-blown IDEs like Visual Studio and text editors like VS Code and Neovim.

This is all based on my own opinion as a professional software developer. I use these
tools a lot, but I'm not an expert in anyone's opinion but my own.

Before I started using it professionally, my impression of Visual Studio was that it was a
high-end, high-powered, luxury tool. Too advanced, too expensive for "beginners like me."

(To be fair, my impression of Vim was also intimidating, but in a different direction. Vim
struck me as an arcane, almost mystical tool. Learnable only by those who had grown up on
the command line. Now, I use and enjoy it.)

But text editors like Sublime Text and VS Code are far more welcoming. They're "just text
editors," and anyone can edit text.

When you open Visual Studio, you see a project template picker and dozens of toolbar
buttons. When you open a good text editor, you see a text area for code. What do tutorials
show? Code.
